I have a huge fascination with insects, particularly dung beetles. I wasn’t much of a coder until I started my PhD. Through the course of my projects and as a teaching assistant, I’ve realized my newfound appreciation to coding and data visualization.\nAs a young researcher, I hope this website serves as an encouragement that you aren’t struggling alone in your own coding journeys.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marx Yim"
