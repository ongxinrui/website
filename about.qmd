I'm a PhD candidate at the Asian School of the Environment in NTU. I have a huge fascination with insects, particularly dung beetles. I wasn't much of a coder until I started my PhD. Through the course of my projects and as a teaching assistant, I've realized my newfound appreciation to coding and data visualization.

As a young researcher, I hope this website serves as an encouragement that you aren't struggling alone in your own coding journeys.
